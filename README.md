# epuck

This epuck2 kernel is updated by Jiacheng Chen, Sheffield Hallam University.
The original code please refer to https://github.com/gctronic/e-puck-library/tree/master/tool/ePic
The working mode of epuck or epuck used to be binary, I changed it to ASCII. 
I will try make more updates of RGB panel, Pi-puck and other extensions.
If you have any other questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact with me (jchenshef@gmail.com).
